# Python coding standards

When generating Python code (modules, classes, functions):

- Include Google-style docstrings.
- Follow Ruff defaults, enforcing rule D212 and line-length limits.
- Use modern type annotations (Python >=3.12).
- Do not use `from typing import ...`.
- Use 4 spaces for indentation.
- Output code only, no explanations.

When generating tests:

- Use pytest.
- Assume pytest is already installed (no setup instructions).
- Include complete and sophisticated unit tests with proper setup/teardown if needed.
- Cover important edge cases.
- Add Python 3.12 type annotations for all functions (no `from typing import`).
- Always specify return types.
- Each test function must include a one-line docstring describing its purpose.
- Output code only, no explanations.

# Git commit message standards

When generating Git commit messages:

- Generate commit messages only from the output of `git diff --cached`.
- Treat the staged diff as the single source of truth.
- If the staged diff is missing, empty, truncated, or ambiguous, ask for the complete output of `git diff --cached` instead of guessing.
- Use the Conventional Commits specification.
- Output only the commit subject (one line, no body, no explanations).
- Keep it concise (preferably <=72 characters).
- Use the imperative mood (e.g. "add", "fix", "remove").
- Choose the most appropriate type (`feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `perf`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `style`, `revert`).
- Prefer the most specific valid Conventional Commit type. Do not use `chore` when another type (`refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `build`, `ci`, etc.) more accurately describes the staged changes.
- Select the commit type based on semantic intent, not file type. For example, updating dependencies without changing behaviour is typically `chore(deps): ...`, not `feat` or `fix`.
- Add a scope only when it meaningfully improves clarity.
- Append `!` only for breaking changes.
- Do not end the subject with a period.

# Command safety

## AWS CLI

Never execute `aws` commands automatically. Always present them to the user and ask them to run manually. This applies to any command that starts with `aws` or invokes the AWS CLI in any form.

## Destructive rm commands

Never automatically run `rm -rf` or `rm -r` on broad or sensitive paths. This includes:

- Home directory (`~/`, `$HOME`)
- Root or top-level system paths (`/`, `/usr`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/opt`, `/mnt`)
- Any path that could contain large amounts of user data (e.g., `~/Documents`, `~/Projects`, `/mnt/data*`)
- Any recursive delete where the target is a variable or glob that could expand unexpectedly

For these cases, present the command and ask the user to run it manually.

Deleting small, specific files or build artifacts (e.g., `rm -rf node_modules`, `rm -rf .venv`, `rm -rf dist/`) within a project directory is fine.

# Project: Process DCM

Python library and CLI (`process-dcm`) that extracts images from ophthalmic DICOM files (OCT, fundus, FA, SLO,
Optomap, ...) into PNG/JPG/WEBP plus one `metadata.json` per acquisition, with optional patient anonymisation.

## Layout and tooling

This repo follows the Eye2Gene [e2g-pypkg](https://github.com/eye2Gene/e2g-pypkg) template (tracked via `.cruft.json`):

- src layout: `src/process_dcm/` with `main.py` (Typer CLI, entry point `process-dcm`), `utils.py` (processing),
  `const.py` (`ImageModality` / `ModalityFlag`). Tests and sample DICOMs live in `tests/`.
- uv for environments and locking, `uv_build` as build backend. No Poetry.
- Ruff for formatting and linting (line length 120, `target-version = "py311"`), ty for type checking. No mypy, no pre-commit.
- pytest with coverage, `-n auto` (pytest-xdist) by default. Warnings are errors (see `tests/conftest.py`).
- `just` recipes are the single interface for dev commands; CI runs the same recipes.
- Minimum Python 3.11 (ruff targets it). Develop with 3.12 (`.python-version`). Move both to 3.12 once every
  Eye2Gene consumer of process-dcm is on 3.12.
- process-dcm keeps its own per-dataset state in plain `pdcm_*` attributes on pydicom datasets (`pdcm_modality`,
  `pdcm_group`, `pdcm_source`; see the comment at the top of `utils.py`). Never store it in real DICOM elements:
  pydicom 3 warns on every non-conformant value and the file's own values get clobbered.

## Commands

```bash
uv sync                      # create .venv with all dev groups
just qa                      # ruff format + ruff check --fix + ty check + uv audit
just ci                      # same, without fixes (what CI runs)
just test [PYTEST_ARGS]      # pytest with coverage, parallel
just pdb [PYTEST_ARGS]       # pytest --pdb, single process
just build                   # uv build -> dist/
uv run process-dcm INPUT -o OUT -f png --overwrite   # run the CLI
```

## Output contract

- Default layout: one flat folder per acquisition group, `{patient}_{date}_{time}[_{hash}]_{eye}_{modality}.DCM`,
  with `source_file` in the metadata relative to the current working directory. Downstream tools rely on this.
  `--preserve_folder_structure`, `--keep_dcm_name_as_folder` and `--relative_source_file` are opt-in alternatives
  added for a downstream tool (PR #6); never flip their defaults.
- Unknown OP/OPT images are exported under the `U` modality; only unsupported objects (other modalities without a
  recognisable modality code, OCT angiography report renderings) are skipped.
- A group may mix eyes and acquisition times (issue #5). Each image entry carries its own `laterality` and
  `scan_datetime`; the series-level `laterality` is `B` and the folder eye is `OU` when the group mixes eyes, and the
  exam-level `scan_datetime` is the earliest in the group.
- `metadata.json` carries `parser_version` for the JSON format and `py_dcm_version` for the package version. Bump
  `parser_version` whenever the metadata schema changes. History: 1.5.3 added `source_file`; 1.6.0 added
  `sop_instance_uid` / `sop_class_uid` per image and `photo_locations` entries with a `start` point only for circular
  B-scans; 1.7.0 (current) added `laterality` / `scan_datetime` per image.

## Testing notes

- `tests/example_dir` (~625 MB of sample DICOMs) is deliberately not in git. Tests that need it skip when it is absent.
- Many tests assert MD5 hashes of generated PNGs and of `metadata.json` (minus its last lines, which hold the version
  numbers). PNG bytes depend on the Pillow version and on the platform (macOS vs Linux wheels) even when pixels are
  identical, so PNG hash lists accept several values. When a dependency bump changes a hash, verify pixels are unchanged
  before appending the new hash. Metadata hashes have a single value: input files are processed in sorted order.
- `tests/DICOM/0001-0003` are symlinks to `tests/example-dcms`; the mirrored output layout must not resolve symlinks.

## Releases

- Conventional commits only. Merging to `main` runs `release.yml`: python-semantic-release computes the version from
  commit messages, updates `pyproject.toml` and `CHANGELOG.md`, tags, creates the GitHub Release, and publishes to
  PyPI via trusted publishing. Never edit the version by hand.
- The package version is read at runtime from installed metadata (`process_dcm.__version__`); there is no hardcoded
  version string in the source.
